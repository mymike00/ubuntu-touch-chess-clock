"A player loses in this time control when they allow the difference between "
"both clocks to reach the specified total amount. For example, if the total "
"is defined as one minute, both players start their clocks at thirty seconds. "
"Every second the first player uses to think in their moves is subtracted "
"from their clock and added to their opponent's clock. If they use thirty "
"seconds to move, the difference between the clocks reaches one minute, and "
"the time flag falls to indicate that they lose by time. If they have used "
"twenty nine seconds and then push the clock's button, they have one second "
"left on their clock and their opponent has fifty-nine seconds."

"Before a player has made their move, a specified time increment is added to "
"their clock. Time can be accumulated, so if the player moves within the "
"delay period, their remaining time actually increases. For example, if the "
"delay time is five seconds, and a player has four seconds left on their "
"clock, as soon as their opponent moves, they receive the increment and has "
"nine seconds to make a move. If they take two seconds to move, on the start "
"of their next move they have twelve seconds."

"With the Bronstein timing method, the increment is always added after the "
"move. But unlike Fischer, not always the maximum increment is added. If a "
"player expends more than the specified increment, then the entire increment "
"is added to the player's clock. But if a player has moved faster than the "
"time increment, only the exact amount of time expended by the player is "
"added. For example, if the delay is five seconds, the player has ten seconds "
"left in their clock before their turn and during their turn they spend three "
"seconds, after they press the clock button to indicate the end of their "
"turn, their clock increases by only three seconds (not five). This ensures "
"that the time left on the clock can never increase, even if a player makes "
"fast moves."
